# Micro Forming Studies of SS316L

## Overview
This project explores the **Forming Limit Curve (FLC)** of SS316L biomaterial using numerical simulation and experimental techniques.

## Objective
- To determine forming limits of SS316L for biomedical applications.
- To validate numerical simulations with experimental results.

## Results
- Numerical FLC was **5-12% lower** than experimental results, ensuring safer designs.
- Stress-strain curves closely matched theoretical expectations.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Software**: Simufact Forming V15
- **Material**: SS316L
